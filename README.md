This is a basic demo app that I made to get a feel for how to develop a node.js app for deployment to [openshift](https://www.openshift.com/). A sort of openshift hello world you could say.

This project is, or at least started as the Node.js 0.10 cartridges sample app found [here](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/tree/master/cartridges/openshift-origin-cartridge-nodejs/usr/template).

If all goes well this should be up and running at my [openshift](http://demo-dustinpfister.rhcloud.com/) account.
